\section{The Problem}

\begin{frame}{Current Challenges in AI-Assisted Development}
  \begin{block}{Lack of Reproducibility}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item AI-generated code appears in repositories without context
      \item No record of the prompts or iterations that created it
      \item Difficult to understand the reasoning behind design choices
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Knowledge Silos}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Effective prompts remain in individual developers' chat histories
      \item No mechanism to share successful prompt strategies
      \item Teams reinvent the wheel when solving similar problems
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Adaptation Challenges}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Hard to replicate solutions in different languages/frameworks
      \item Cannot trace how code evolved through prompt refinement
      \item Limited ability to learn from others' AI interactions
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
