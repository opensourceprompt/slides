\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  \begin{block}{What: Open Source Prompt Initiative}
    A standardized ecosystem for capturing, sharing, and replaying AI coding prompts alongside the generated code in version control systems.
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Why: The Value Proposition}
    \begin{itemize}
      \small
      \item \textbf{Reproducibility}: Recreate AI-generated code with full context
      \item \textbf{Knowledge Transfer}: Share effective prompting strategies across teams
      \item \textbf{Cross-Language Porting}: Adapt implementations to different technologies
      \item \textbf{Code Provenance}: Understand the origin and intent of AI-generated code
      \item \textbf{Collaboration}: Build on each other's work with transparency
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{The Vision}
    Making AI-assisted development transparent, reproducible, and collaborative for the open source community.
  \end{block}
